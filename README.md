## Bitcoin Mixer List

A Bitcoin mixer list is a structured comparison of various Bitcoin mixer services based on features, privacy protocols, transaction minimums and maximums, fee transparency, and reputation.

Bitcoin mixer lists help users and researchers compare available services without endorsing any specific service, and provide a neutral perspective on their performance.

## What Is a Bitcoin Mixer?

A Bitcoin mixer (sometimes called a Bitcoin tumbler) is a privacy-enhancing service designed to obscure the connection between Bitcoin addresses. Mixers work by pooling and redistributing coins in a way that makes it harder to track the original source of funds.

## How Bitcoin Mixers Work

Bitcoin mixers generally follow this process:

1. Coins are sent to a temporary mixing address
2. The funds are pooled with other users’ coins
3. Coins are redistributed to new Bitcoin addresses
4. Optional time delays and output variations are applied

This process is used to make it difficult to track transactions and associate addresses with one another.

## Bitcoin Mixers and CoinJoin

While Bitcoin mixers are a popular tool for enhancing privacy, **CoinJoin** is another important approach used in Bitcoin privacy. CoinJoin combines multiple Bitcoin transactions into a single one, making it much more difficult for anyone to determine which participant sent funds to which recipient.

In 2026, both Bitcoin mixers and CoinJoin-style services are important tools for anyone interested in enhancing privacy on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Bitcoin Mixer Services in 2026

Bitcoin mixers are part of a broader ecosystem that includes various privacy-enhancing technologies.
